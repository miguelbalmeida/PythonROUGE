This is a simple Python wrapper for ROUGE. ROUGE is a Perl script for evaluation of summaries. You can obtain it from http://www.berouge.com/


INSTALLATION:
1) Download ROUGE from http://www.berouge.com/
2) Create a folder somewhere, say /home/you/PythonROUGE
3) Place the "RELEASE-1.5.5" folder you got from ROUGE inside that folder, i.e. /home/you/PythonROUGE/RELEASE-1.5.5
4) Place this package in parallel to the above, i.e. /home/you/PythonROUGE/PythonROUGE.py and /home/you/PythonROUGE/Example


TESTING:
1) Run in a terminal the command "python PythonROUGE.py"
2) You should get as output:

recall = 0.3
precision = 0.6
F = 0.4
